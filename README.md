## Getting Started

Assuming a user does not have an account yet,  this guide walk through how to create an account and customize the account, adding new expenses, income, etc.

Creating an Account

	Once Parrot is opened, the user will be greeted with a log in screen. Tap on the “Sign Up” button below the “Sign In” bar. Parrot will then navigate the user to the create account page where the user will be prompted to enter their first name, last name, email address, and password. After all fields are satisfied, tap on “Sign Up”, and Parrot will navigate the user to their new account’s front page. Note that every box must have an entry when signing up. It would then send the user an email telling you that an account needs to be verified before being able to login. Once the email is verified then the user would be able to login, if not then it will block the user account until otherwise. If the user already has an account, the user can click the cancel button which leads the user back to the login screen.

Adding your salary/income

	You now have a new account and want to enter how much you earn. At the bottom of the screen, you are given an option to add an entry, tap on it, and tap on new income. You will now be greeted with text fields and choices that are needed to generate your income within the Parrot database. Parrot gives you a choice to enter your weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or annual income. Once all fields are satisfied, tap on “Add New Income”. Your new income will now be displayed in your budget chart. This is just a option, if the user doesn’t want to share their income. Then the chart will just show them how much they are spending and not how much they will have left over.
